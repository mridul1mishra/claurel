                            Information silos make
                        <p>
                            Information silos make communication, collaboration and comprehensive analysis of the business more challenging.
                            Finding ways of breaking them down ensures a free flow of data between teams, improves efficiency and makes company more competitive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The formation of silos isn't surprising. In fact, people have a natural tendency to work hard and stay focused in their particular areas of expertise.
                            As company grows and more people are added to individual teams, team members take on specialized roles and departments cultivate their own preferred technology applications.
                            The silos organically create and compound upon themselves, and become their own organisms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finance unit of any small business offers a prime example.
                            Finance uses its own systems for tracking operational expenses, capital costs, revenue and more.
                            But the activity of other teams is deeply relevant to their analysis - and when the information isn't easily connected,
                            the organization can suffer from inefficiencies, lack of communication, and information gaps.
                            It's akin to going to the grocery store without a list:
                            You find yourself running and back forth across the store in order to get what you need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More importantly, through silos lead to missed collaboration and business opportunities. The ability to see information across business units and then connect the dots is frankly what separates good organizations from great organizations. That type of analysis spurs growth and help SMBs spot issues before they become big problems.

                            How to Tear Silos Down<br />
                            <br />
                            If one SMB suffers from silos, don't worry - you'r not alone! But the sooner you break down the proverbial walls, the sooner your company will be able to capitalize on the information you already have available. It's there for taking;you just need to create and facilitate the data flow
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To eliminate silos:
                            <ul class="col-lg-12" style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 30px">
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Identify information touch points
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Examine the barriers to those transactions</li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                        <div class="quotes">
                            With that in mind, there are three key takeaways to ensure true success:
                            <ul class="col-lg-12" style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 30px">
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Cross-channel strategies are only effective when the customer journey for different personas are mapped out (data analytics is key).
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Customer journey mapping should be optimized continuously so marketers are giving the best experience to prospects and prospective customers.
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Each touchpoint needs to have a KPI that matches to the overall objective and is measurable where possible.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    Breaking down silos is exciting—but what you can do next is even more so.
                                    When you’ve broken free from silos, the business components are all functioning as part of the same team.
                                    Thanks to cloud-based technology management, you don’t need to be in the same location to connect data and people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Information sharing becomes more efficient and more accurate.
                                    In addition, you free up employees from what were essentially repetitive administrative tasks.
                                    I was recently at Modern Finance Experience, and heard from a company that had been managing 2,000 spreadsheets related to their monthly close.
                                    Once they deployed our ERP cloud solution, the organization immediately relieved their employees of that burden, giving them the opportunity to do higher-level work.
                                    Among many benefits, this creates opportunities for leadership and cross-functional teams, improving information flow.
