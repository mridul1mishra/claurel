                            Customers do not take a linear path to organizations anymore.
                            Rather, they engage with companies on multiple channels and
                            across channels while pausing and resuming their journey along the way.
                            We know that customers conduct online searches and visit websites before
                            they make their first phone call, and we know that a growing number of
                            consumers call a company while also viewing the internet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a challenge for companies to synchronize multiple channels at the same time
                            within a single journey and manage the customer lifecycle successfully enough to
                            deliver a personalized, contextual experience each time. The multiple disconnected
                            interactions each customer has with a company makes omnichannel customer engagement a
                            business necessity for those companies struggling to manage journeys. Omnichannel customer
                            engagement best practices and solutions empower companies to deliver consistent, personalized
                            customer experiences throughout each journey and across all channels and touchpoints.

                            Challenges of omnichannel customer engagement include

                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Inconsistent information – Customers moving from one channel to the next often find inconsistent information and struggle to make sense of content between channels</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Lack of personalization – Consumers expect experiences to be personalized because they know companies gather data from them, yet gathering data from multiple channels and eliminating siloed data is a challenge for companies</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Customer frustration – Customers seeking support become frustrated when they have to repeat information from one channel to the next and from one agent to the next</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Disjointed omnichannel experiences – Customers expect social networks to be part of their experience and to be able to have a two-way conversation with companies on social media</li>

                                    As new technologies improve and user behavior continues to change,
                                    outdated data collection modeling isn’t going to help, and will more
                                    likely hurt marketing efforts. Improving automated data procedures,
                                    attribution and sources is the best way for marketers to fully utilize
                                    all the benefits of big data collection and analysis for omnichannel campaigns.
