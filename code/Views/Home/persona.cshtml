                        <p class="excert">
                            Every marketer should take a moment and consider who their audience is.
                            Who are they trying to reach? How? And why? You might have a huge and diverse consumer base to look at,
                            but you can break them down into segments. Then based upon the characteristics of each segment, you can
                            create a sketch, or a persona, that stands in for that segment.
                            They act as their representative and avatar when you draw up your content marketing plans and strategies.
                        <p>
                            By creating a marketing persona, you can view that whole segment as a person and put yourself
                            in their shoes. You can ask what keeps them up at night and what pain points do they experience
                            as a part of their job. By breaking a whole segment down into a persona, you can see them more
                            as a person, whom who deserves your empathy and help, rather a huge, disparate group. You have
                            the product and services they need, and you can focus on properly reaching them with that message
                            and connecting with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What, however, goes into crafting a marketing persona?

                            As with almost everything that is marketing related, it comes down to data.
                            The more you know about your audience the better you can craft marketing personas that
                            represent them and can help you create content that can solve their business problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Parse through the data you have collected on your prospects and customers.  What are their:
                            <ul class="col-lg-12" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px">
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Preferences and interests

                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Job titles and responsibilities
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Age, gender, salary
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    Education, family, and other background information
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is all more general information. If you have any data on your customers’ hobbies, the blogs they read, the news sources they prefer, the types of content that better engage them, how good they are with certain types of software, and the social media channels they use, it can all create a stronger persona.

                            Once you have put all that information together into a sketch of a person, ask yourself:


                            What values do they hold?
                            What fears do they possess? What annoys and irks them?
                            What do they not like about the sales process and what might they be worried about if they are seeking a new solution? What would stand out to them and impress them?
                            Most importantly of all, how can your services help with all of that?
                            <ul class="col-lg-12" style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 30px">
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">
                                    What challenges do they face at their jobs and what must their goals be?
                                </li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">What values do they hold?</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">What fears do they possess? What annoys and irks them?</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">What do they not like about the sales process and what might they be worried about if they are seeking a new solution? What would stand out to them and impress them?</li>
                                <li style="padding-left: 15px">Most importantly of all, how can your services help with all of that?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                        <div class="quotes">
                            Most importantly of all, how can your services help with all of that?
                            The answers to those questions can all mix and stir together into what
                            your marketing message to that persona is. Quite simply, your message should
                            tell them what you can do for them, how it solves their problems, and how they benefit.
                            <br />
                            The next step then involves you making your pitch to them. What is the best way you can
                            convey your message to a persona? How can you reach, connect, and engage them?
                            Each persona is going to be slightly different, but the data will indicate the best way
                            to go about marketing to each.<br />
