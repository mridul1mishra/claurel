                            It’s one thing to understand that help wins as
                            a personalization tactic. It’s another to actually
                            build meaningful personalized experiences
                            that help consumers to buy. The opportunity for
                            personalization success means ramping up efforts
                            in this area through two discrete steps:

                                Identify the specific type(s) of help your consumers
                                value in combination with what the brand can
                                reasonably expect to deliver. One option is to assess
                                the entire consumer purchase journey for high-value
                                moments, where the brand can critically insert itself to
                                help consumers overcome a friction point. Or identify
                                empathy points — moments across the buying journey
                                that have a disproportionate impact on consumer
                                perceptions. Cross-functional groups comprising
                                internal stakeholders with insight into consumer
                                needs can help surface ideas to pursue

                            1. Identify and prioritize what categories of help

                            2. Build a portfolio of tools that can be used to

                                    Organizations looking to become more proficient at
                                    personalization require technical and analytical capabilities
                                    to effectively use the data they collect — and must manage
                                    the risks of holding and using more personal data and
                                    delivering messages that are personal enough to be relevant
                                    but not so personal as to be intrusive.
                                    Consumers find personalization valuable but may see
                                    the value very differently than the organizations trying to
                                    provide it. In particular, consumers favor personalization
                                    designed to help over personalization used by brands
                                    simply to demonstrate the company knows something
                                    about them
